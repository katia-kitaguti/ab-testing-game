# 🐈 A/B Testing
This project was developed to improve my knowledges regarding Hypothesis Tests, using a different dataset.

1. Data treatments of  [A/B testing base extracted directly from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yufengsui/mobile-games-ab-testing)
2. Hypothesis tests. In this part, I used [this Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/code/karakaseren/ab-testing-for-cookie-cats) as reference
